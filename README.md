# Simple Assembly x86 snippets

Some programs I've written in Assembly language in high school (year: 2014/2015).  
These snippets involve various Assembly programming techniques from very basic concepts (like **performing a math operation**) 
to more complex ones (like **serial communication** and **graphic manipulation**).

Specifically, these snippets are written in _Assembly 8086_, so they can run onto an **Intel 8086 microprocessor**.
